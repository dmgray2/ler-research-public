# How to run on the sample dataset

This repo includes a small JSONL sample dataset:
`data/samples/minpairs.ce2fam.v0.7_nf2000.sample200.jsonl`

To reproduce scoring locally, you need Python plus the dependencies used by the scorer.
See the private `ler-minpairs` repo for the full pipeline; this public repo focuses on curated artifacts and small examples.
